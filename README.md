The application was redeveloped to meet user needs, utilizing the waterfall method for structured development. Black Box Testing and User Acceptance Testing were performed, confirming successful feature functionality and high user acceptance rate of 94.25%. This project was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis, which was subsequently published as [a journal article](https://ejournal.poltektedc.ac.id/index.php/jiee/article/view/815).
